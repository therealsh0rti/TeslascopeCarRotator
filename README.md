I'm not about to spend $5 registration fee for the Chrome Web Store just for this, so to use:
1. Clone or download the files into a directory on your system.
2. In Chrome, open the Extensions page.
3. Enable "developer mode" in the upper right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder where you put the files.
5. Optionally, you may now disable developer mode again.

If you update the extension files while Chrome is open, don't forget to reload the extension via the same menu.
